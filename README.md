Brief idea:
Traditionally when an individual is diagnosed with Dementia, one of the first thoughts that goes through their head is the overwhelming fear that they will no longer be able to go on with their life independently and that they will become a burden to their loved ones. At Team Synaptic, we are proud to unveil our "A.I." app lovingly named S.A.R.A.H., the Speech Answer and Reminder Adaptable Helper, that aims to alleviate much of the stress associated with early stage Dementia from the affected individuals, as well as their caregivers. Our proprietary A.I. is personalized with live schedule changes from the caregiver, allowing the diagnosed individual to independently and effortlessly ask a wide range of specific questions 24/7, 365 days a week.

The Full Story: 
As a group of Grade 11 high school students, our first DementiaHack presented a daunting yet extremely exciting opportunity to go out of our coding comfort zones while giving back to the community! As a team of 4 self-taught novice programmers, our day started with merely an idea that we were determined to make a reality. Fast forward about 30 hours, and we are proud of the current feature set of S.A.R.A.H.. We intend to continue supporting and improving on our app as we have dozens of more features we would love to implement, ranging from adding more compatible relevant question and answer types based on different stages of Dementia to integration with appliance status apps.
